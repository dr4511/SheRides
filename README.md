# SheRides
A ride-share service created by women, for women

Inspiration:
According to youth tech health, nearly 45 percent of female passengers prefer female drivers.

What it does:
Our website allows users to find local drivers in their area that either identify as women or as a gender minority.

How we built it:
We applied our skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website. To design the website, we utilized Figma.

Challenges we ran into:
Originally, we wanted implement our idea into an app, however we ran into issues trying to figure out how to use Kivy and Flutter for app development so we ended up sticking with what we knew best.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Coming up with an idea that we'd like to build upon for the future

What we learned:
For those of us that weren't as experienced with web development, we learned a lot through trial and error

What's next for SheRides:
Making SheRides into an app for IOS and android, and building upon the services we offer within the app such as the phone call simulator.
